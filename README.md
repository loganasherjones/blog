# Logan's Blog

This is my blog site. It is generated using Hugo and the hugo-tranquilpeak-theme.

## Running in development mode

Just Run:
```
hugo serve -D
```


## Creating a new post

Just create new content in `content/post`. End it in `.md`. Set `draft: true` in the header while you're working on it. Once you're ready to publish, just push!
